Deterministic systems require instantaneous feedback in order to a apply the system. The inputs and outputs are fully
 know and can be exactly calculated. This produces a very precises and understandable result in-situ. An example of this
 is an entrance exam for a college, you know your input (test answers) and you also know your exact output (correct answers
 / total answers).


probabilistic systems do not require instantaneous feed back, becasue the the input is known but the out put is not 
exactly know, it is a probability. This allows for a very dynamic model that can be used without constant updates. The 
down side is the accuracy of the model. A good example would be a prediction of a stock market price. This inputs are
 know (what the stock was yesterday), but the outputs are not exactly know, just a probability.

Notes
1. Thompson Sampling is impressive!
One additional pro I can imagine is that it can follow dynamic changes of the distribution. if bandits are changing their 
behaviour in time (of coure much slower than or draw period) I presume TS should follow the change, while UCB will just 
stick to a decision which once was right and now is no longer optimal.
