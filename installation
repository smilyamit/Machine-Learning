###0 tf 1.x installation guide for windows/mac
-Before creating any virtual env, first create folder and then create conda virtual env using below command. Though that virtual env will be available outside
the folder. just to remember where it is created. create venv inside in any folder (eg: amittiwari/ml/first_venv)
-before creatinf first check what venv are available (so that u can decide whether new one is needed or not, delete older one)
- to check venv (conda info --env)

conda create -n tf_1 python=3.7.4 (to create virtual env)
-to check installed files/package
conda list

conda activate tf_1                     (activate virtual env)
pip install -U pip               (to upgrade pip)
conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn (to install small library)
conda install -c conda-forge keras  (to install all tf, keras, theano and others)

#To deactivate created env
$ conda deactivate


# to check the available env
$ conda info --env


*** Below installion guid is for tf 2.x
#1
To check the default environment location in mac: /opt/anaconda3/envs/tf. (make sure u r in default position in terminal)

#2 (for OS X or Linux)
Run the following commands to setup your environment:

conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
source activate tensorflow
conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow   (if we give without any vers than it will install latest version)

AND
Windows

And installing on Windows. In your console or Anaconda shell,

conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
activate tensorflow
conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow

#3 To deactivate created env
$ conda deactivate

* to again open
$ conda activate <name of env>  eg $ conda activate tf

** to know which are the environment created locally
$ conda info --envs

** to remove created env
conda env remove -n <ENV_NAME>

#After going to new env (eg $ conda activate tf1.14)
pip install tensorflow==1.14 keras
conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn
conda install spyder
* to check verson of any library eg 
1) import tensorflow as tf
   tf.__version__
2) tf.VERSION



#4 in Jupyter notebook
a) after . just use tab to see options available
b) in braces just use shift + tab to see signature of functions
c) in case of from ... import ... just put cursor in front but back of import and hit tab
eg from keras.datasets import reuters  ,here put cursor infront of reuters and hit tab to get others options
